## Real-World Applications of Photonic Qubits

While this research focuses on the theoretical mapping of electromagnetic wave properties (amplitude, phase, polarization) to qubit behavior, the practical implications of photonic quantum computing are profound.

### 1. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)
Polarization-encoded photons are already used in secure communication protocols such as **BB84**, which leverages quantum superposition and no-cloning principles to enable **unbreakable encryption**. The techniques simulated in this paper can be adapted to model QKD systems using light waves.

### 2. Quantum Internet
Photonic qubits are ideal for transmitting quantum information over long distances through optical fibers, enabling the **quantum internet**. Since photons travel at light speed and have low interaction with the environment, they are suitable for long-distance quantum teleportation and entanglement-based communication.

### 3. High-Speed Quantum Networking
Unlike superconducting or trapped-ion qubits, photons **do not require ultra-cold environments** and can be manipulated using mature photonics technology. This makes them excellent candidates for **scalable and room-temperature** quantum networks.

### 4. Hybrid Quantum Systems
Photonic qubits can also act as **interconnects** between different quantum systems â€” for instance, carrying quantum information between superconducting qubit modules or ion-trap processors.

### 5. Secure Voting and Authentication
Future digital identity systems may leverage entangled photons and polarization encoding to perform secure, verifiable transactions in **quantum-resistant authentication systems**.

These applications demonstrate that photonic qubits are not only theoretically valid but also **extremely practical for real-world use**. The simulation methods explored in this paper can be further extended to design and test such systems.
