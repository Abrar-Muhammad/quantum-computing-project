# Grover's Algorithm

## Grover’s Theorem — Photon-Based Quantum Search Perspective

### What Is Grover’s Theorem?

Grover’s Theorem states that a quantum computer can solve unstructured search problems significantly faster than classical computers. While a classical search through an unsorted database of **N** items takes **O(N)** steps, a quantum computer can do it in only **O(√N)** steps using **Grover’s Algorithm**.

This quadratic speed-up has important implications for fields like cryptography, optimization, and artificial intelligence.

### My Photonic Qubit Approach

In this research, I am exploring **photons (light particles)** as viable carriers of quantum information. By mapping qubit states to **polarization states of light** (e.g., horizontal = ∣0⟩, vertical = ∣1⟩), I have already simulated core quantum operations such as:

- Superposition  
- Entanglement  
- Quantum teleportation

Now, I aim to implement **Grover’s Algorithm** under this photonic framework — using **Qiskit simulations** to demonstrate that **light-based qubits** can efficiently perform quantum search operations.

### What I Am Trying to Do with Grover’s Theorem

My next objective is to:

1. **Simulate Grover’s Algorithm** using Qiskit with a focus on photonic qubit behavior.  
2. Demonstrate that **polarization-encoded qubits** (representing light) can be used to perform Grover's search.  
3. Visualize the **amplitude amplification** — where the correct solution’s probability is boosted — through Bloch spheres, city plots, and histograms.  
4. Explore how **optical components** (like beam splitters and wave plates) might physically implement the necessary Grover operations in future experimental setups.

### Why This Matters

By successfully simulating Grover’s algorithm using photon-based qubits, we move one step closer to practical, light-driven quantum processors capable of real-world quantum search tasks.

This supports the hypothesis that **light is not just a transmission medium**, but also a **computational medium** in future quantum architectures — ideal for scalable, room-temperature quantum systems.
