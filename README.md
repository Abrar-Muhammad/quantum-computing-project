# Quantum Computing Research Project

👋 Welcome!  
This repository contains my quantum computing research projects. These are part of my effort to gain admission into top global universities with a focus on science and technology.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Quantum Logic Gates
- Grover's Algorithm
- Quantum Teleportation
- Quantum Cryptography (BB84)

## 🧪 Tools Used
- Python
- Qiskit
- IBM Quantum Lab

## 📈 Goals
- Understand core quantum computing concepts
- Simulate and build quantum circuits
- Share insights and progress

## How I Built This

This project was developed over 4 weeks using:

- Research from online papers, IBM Qiskit docs, and YouTube lectures
- Visual diagrams made in Draw.io
- Coding in IBM Quantum Lab and Google Colab
- I wrote and formatted all the content myself

This was not copied. I used ChatGPT only for explanations and formatting guidance, but the ideas, connections, and writing are my own.
