# Quantum Computing Research Project

 Welcome!  
This repository contains my quantum computing research projects. These are part of my effort to gain admission into top global universities with a focus on science and technology.

## Hypothesis

It is possible to represent and manipulate quantum information using photon polarization as qubits, simulating core quantum operations such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum teleportation. By visualizing the wavefunction and Bloch sphere of photon-based qubits in simulation, we can demonstrate that light is a viable and scalable medium for future quantum communication and computing protocols such as quantum teleportation and BB84.

## Advantages of Using Photons as Qubits

### 1.Low Decoherence
Photons interact very weakly with their environment, making them highly resistant to decoherence. This allows quantum states encoded in light to remain stable over long distances and periods ‚Äî ideal for quantum communication.

### 2.Room-Temperature Operation
Unlike many matter-based qubit systems that require ultra-cold environments (like superconducting qubits), photonic systems can function at room temperature, making them more accessible and scalable.

### 3.High-Speed Transmission
Since photons are the fastest known information carriers (traveling at the speed of light), they are naturally suited for fast quantum communication and real-time distributed quantum computing.

### 4.Long-Distance Quantum Communication
Photons can travel through optical fibers or free space over large distances with minimal loss, enabling protocols like quantum teleportation, entanglement distribution, and quantum key distribution (QKD) ‚Äî including the BB84 protocol.

### 5.Polarization-Based Encoding
Quantum states can be encoded in the polarization of photons (e.g., horizontal = |0‚ü©, vertical = |1‚ü©), which can be precisely manipulated using common optical elements such as wave plates and beam splitters.

### 6.Easier Integration with Classical Optics
Photonic qubits can be manipulated using well-understood and commercially available classical optics technologies, allowing smoother integration into hybrid quantum‚Äìclassical systems.

### 7.Scalability and Miniaturization
Advances in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are making it possible to scale up quantum photonic systems using chips that manipulate light at the nanoscale ‚Äî paving the way for compact and scalable quantum processors.

### 8.Compatibility with Existing Infrastructure
Because photons can be transmitted via standard telecom fiber networks, photonic qubits are more compatible with today‚Äôs communication infrastructure, accelerating adoption in real-world applications.
